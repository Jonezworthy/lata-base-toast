Latabase with toast notifications


# How to run
All you need to do is run the .ps1 script with a single string argument that you wish to have as the reminder

powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden PATH\lata-base.ps1 'Notification'

We recommend creating an environment variable to make this quicker
e.g

r = powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden PATH\lata-base.ps1 

> So all you need to do to run it is put %r% hello in run command
